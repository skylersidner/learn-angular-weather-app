# learn-angular-weather-app
Angular application as directed by Anthony Alicea's Udemy course, [Learn and Understand AngularJS](https://www.udemy.com/learn-angularjs/learn/v4/overview)

The code for this project is available for download, but I'm attempting to recreate it using Angular 1.5 (instead of his 1.3), by hand.  The purpose is to become more familiar with Javascript, Angular, and the troubleshooting that comes with typos, errors, etc.
